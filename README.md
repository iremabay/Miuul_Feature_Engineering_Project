# Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Model

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not when their features are provided. The necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps are expected to be performed before developing the model.

## Dataset Story

This dataset is a part of the large dataset maintained at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. It is used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and older, residing in Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in the state of Arizona. The target variable is specified as 'outcome', where 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicates a negative result.

## Variables and Meanings

- **Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies.
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
- **Blood Pressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness:** Skinfold thickness.
- **Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function (a function based on family history).
- **BMI:** Body mass index.
- **Age:** Age in years.
- **Outcome:** Whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Important Libraries

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Used for numerical computations.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Used for data visualization.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Used for statistical data visualization.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Used for machine learning algorithms and evaluation.

Make sure you have these libraries installed in your environment to run the project successfully.
